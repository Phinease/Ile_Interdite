Professor: Thibaut Balabonski


  The island contains priceless archaeological treasures, which you have come to collect. But the Island
  dark, its different parts disappear little by little, and the whole will soon be swallowed up by the
  waves. In this Matt Leacock game, players must cooperate to slow the progression of
  the wave long enough to retrieve four artifacts and escape by a helicopter before
  the inevitable and imminent disappearance of the last vestiges of the Island.
  This project is to build an electronic and slightly simplified version of this game.
